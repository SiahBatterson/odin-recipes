      <h1>Hot Cider</h1>
      <img src="cider.webp" alt="alternatetext" />
      <p>
        a drink made from freshly pressed apples, offering a natural, sweet, and
        slightly tangy flavor. Often enjoyed warm with spices or chilled, it's a
        refreshing and comforting beverage, especially popular in the fall.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>10â€“12 medium apples (assorted types), quartered</li>
        <li>
          2 oranges, quartered (also peeled, if you would like your cider less
          tart*)
        </li>
        <li>4 cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon whole cloves</li>
        <li>
          optional extra seasonings: 1 teaspoon whole allspice, 1 whole nutmeg,
          and/or 1 inch fresh ginger
        </li>
        <li>16 cups water, more or less</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sweetener</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="steps">
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li>
          Combine your ingredients in a stockpot. Add the apples, oranges,
          cinnamon, cloves and (optional) extra seasonings to a large stockpot.
          Cover with water, leaving about an inch or two of space at the top of
          the stockpot.
        </li>
        <li>
          Simmer. Heat the cider over high heat until it reaches a simmer. Then
          reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for about 2 hours, or
          until the apples are completely soft.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mash the apples and oranges. Using a potato masher or a wooden spoon,
          take a minute to mash all of the apples and oranges against the side
          of the stockpot to release more of their flavors. Then cover and
          simmer for 1 more hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Strain. Using a fine-mesh strainer or a cheesecloth, strain out all of
          the solids (apples, oranges, spices), pressing them against the
          strainer to release all of their juices. Discard the solids.
        </li>
        <li>Sweeten. Stir in your desired amount of sweetener, to taste.</li>
        <li>
          Serve warm. Then, your cider is all ready to go! For extra
          presentation points, I like to add a few fresh orange slices and
          cinnamon sticks back to the stockpot for pretty serving. But however
          you like to serve it, your cider is now ready to go and enjoy. Or feel
          free to let the cider cool to room temperature, then transfer to a
          sealed pitcher and refrigerate for up to 5 days. Or freeze for up to 3
          months.
